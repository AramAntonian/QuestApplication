        The house museum of the Armenian great poet Avetik Isahakian is on the nice-looking and peaceful Zarobian street parallel to Baghramian Avenue. The last ten years of his life he lived in this house.
        After his death in 1958, in reference to 1st May 67-P decision of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR, Avetik Isahakianâ€™s house was changed into his house museum with the purpose to immortalize the name of the eminent Armenian poet.
        The main function of the house museum of Avetik Isahakian is to protect and pass to further generations the sacred relics and material evidences connected with the name of the great poet and bear the sign of his creative hand. He is not present under this roof only physically. His luminous spirit is here forever, in this house, and as an everlasting companion is always with his people.
        The activities of the house museum are: the maintenance, accounting and investigation of the museum collection, as well as, informing the public about the literary inheritance of Isahakian with the help of the permanent exposition and exhibitions, various events and lectures.
